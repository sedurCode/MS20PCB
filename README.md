# MS20PCB
These are gerber files &amp; KiCad board file for the LMNC MS20 filter w/ hi pass option

This is based off the Look Mum No Computer version of the Clacktronics version of the Rene Schmitz version of the Korg MS20 filter. 
LMNC laid it out on stripboard and I put it into KiCad cos that's how I do things.
Figured I'd share it for other learners.

Version history:
Currently on V2.0. V1.0 had a broken ground trace from pin 9 of the opamp. Added quality of life changes incl:
-via mounting holes, 
-bigger footprints for larger capacitors,
-clearer DPDT links. 

Not really sure how github works so feel free to reach out! Peace
